  <Description>
Zynq UltraScale+ consists of a Processing System (PS), a Platform Management Unit (PMU) and Programmable Logic (PL).

These designs offer a Zynq UltraScale+ Processor-based subsystem comprised of: 

An implementation of  an ARM v8A architecture profile with a quad-core A53 and 1MB of L2 cache with memory virtualization, hardware virtualization for hypervisors and TrustZone security extensions to execute platform OSes
	
An implementation of an ARM v7R architecture profile with two Cortex R5Fs, a Memory Protection Unit (MPU), caches and Tightly Coupled Memories (TCMs) that can be configured in split or lock-step mode suitable for real-time deterministic applications
	
Integrated memory mapped peripherals
	
A hardened DDR memory controller
	
256KB of On-Chip Memory

The Processing System capabilities can be augmented by leveraging the Programmable Logic.
