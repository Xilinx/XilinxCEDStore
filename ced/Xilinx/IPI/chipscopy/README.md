# chipscopy_ced
Configurable Example Design to illustrate features of ChipScope debug cores and ChipScopy API

This CED creates a design for either the VCK190 or the VMK180 that illustrates features of
ChipScope.  This includes fabric debug cores like ILA but also instantiates Versal hard
blocks that can be queried/controlled at runtime, like the GT Quads, NoC, and DDRMCs.
