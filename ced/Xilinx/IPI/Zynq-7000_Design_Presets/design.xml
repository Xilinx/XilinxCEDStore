  <Description>
Zynq-7000 consists of a Processing System (PS) and programmable logic (PL).

These designs offer a Zynq-7000 Processor-based subsystem comprised of: 

An implementation of  an ARM v7A architecture profile with a dual-core A9 and 512kB of L2 cache with lock down support, memory virtualization, hardware virtualization and TrustZone security extensions to execute platform OSes

Integrated memory mapped peripherals

A hardened DDR memory controller

256KB of On-Chip Memory

The Processing System capabilities can be augmented by leveraging the Programmable Logic.
