<Description>
This embedded design offers a MicroBlaze subsystem that can be targeted for the following use cases.

Microcontroller: This is a cache-less processor subsystem optimized for low-latency highly deterministic operations.

Real-time Processor: This is a cache based processor subsystem with an MPU capable of running a deterministic real-time operating system.

Application Class Processor: This is a cache based processor subsystem with an MMU for virtualized memory required by operating systems like Linux.

All designs include basic peripherals such as an I2C controller, SPI Controller, UART, Timer and Interrupt Controller.
