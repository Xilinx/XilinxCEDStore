CIPS VIP Example Design

Objective
This example design demonstrates how to use the CIPs VIP to send and receive AXI and NoC traffic in a Versal design.

The CIPs VIP documentation is available on the lounge at https://www.xilinx.com/member/versal-cips-vip-ea.html.

Refer to AR# 75889 for CIPS VIP release notes and known issues. https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/75889.html


Required Hardware and Tools
2022.2 Vivado
No hardware is required.

Running the Simulation
1. IP output products are not included as part of the example design and need to be generated. Generate output products for the block design. Select global for a quick turnaround and then run the simulation
