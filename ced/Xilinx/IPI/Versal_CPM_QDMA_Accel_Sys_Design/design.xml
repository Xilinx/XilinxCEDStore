<DisplayName>Versal CPM5 QDMA Based Acceleration System Design</DisplayName>

<Description>This example design will show-case end user application features to demonstrate system level operation for key features for Versal devices.

This design will cover the following functionalities:

  Segmented Configuration
  Load PLD image over PCIe to SBI – use QDMA driver.
  For the QDMA-MM data path - H2C/C2H:
    - Execution of H2C transfer
    - Generation of IPI Interrupt
    - Processing of H2C data
    - Triggering of an interrupt to the host via the usr_irq interface of CPM5-QDMA from the APU
    - Completion of C2H transfer
  The H2C data processing is initiated by an application on the APU (A72).
  Regarding the QDMA-ST data path - H2C/C2H:
    - Implementation of H2C transfer
    - Processing of H2C data
    - Retrieval of descriptors through the dsc_crdt/dsc_byp interfaces of CPM5-QDMA
    - Execution of C2H transfer
  The C2H-ST transfer is supported using:
    - Internal method
    - Simple bypass method
    - Csh bypass method
  Access to the following memory regions via the PCIe link will be demonstrated
    - OCM
    - RTCA
    - SBI
    - QSPI
    - CPM
    - Inter Processer Interrupt registers
