<DisplayName>MicroBlaze V Design Presets (Spartan UltraScale+)</DisplayName>

<Description>
This embedded design offers a MicroBlaze V subsystem that can be targeted for the following use cases.

Microcontroller: This is a cache-less processor subsystem optimized for low-latency highly deterministic operations.

Real-time Processor: This is a cache based processor subsystem with an MPU capable of running a deterministic real-time operating system.

All designs include basic peripherals such as a UART, Timer and BRAM.
