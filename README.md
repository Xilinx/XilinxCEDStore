# XilinxCEDStore
Welcome to the Xilinx CED Store GitHub Repository.

The CED Store is an open source repository of example designs designed primarily for use with the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite. An xitem corresponds to a group or collection of one or more example designs that is published and maintained by an owner. The xitem owner acts as a gatekeeper for that code and we only accept contributions for an app from the owner. In addition, the entire repository is managed by a Xilinx gatekeeper that controls pushes to the private and public repos.

This feature is supported from Vivado 2019.2 release
